# Hi There! 😁

## About Me 👩🏼‍💻
My name is Zoe Bailey, I am a junior at West Virginia University studying computer engineering. I have worked with artificial intellegence (machine learning, computer vision, natural language proccessing), and spesificially AI in the health and legal sectors. I am interested in any work that helps the greater good of humanity. 

## Tech Stack 💻
I have experience and expertise coding in multiple languages including:
- Python 🐍
- Java ☕️
- C 🛜
- MATLAB 👷🏼‍♀️
- PLC 🪜
- HTML 🕸️
- CSS 👩🏼‍🎨
- VHDL ⚙️

## Key Projects 🔧
📌 AI in the Legal Sector, Chronology Generating Bot for LegalDuel 👩🏼‍⚖️

Working with LegalDuel, me and a team of two other students created a chatbot to successfully generate legal chronologies given a document. Legal chronologies can be very burdensome and tedious to write, so to aid the legal sector, we used AI to help! We used Python, HTML, Java, and more to code. We implemented ChatGPT's API to aid us in completion and evaluation. Along with this, we made a website to host these tasks (and generate a visual timeline)!

Repository: 

📌 AI to Detect Cancerous Cells, Computer Vision with AI Camp 🩻
📌 LED Temperature Sensor, Transmitting Code for Microprocessor Systems Project 🌡️
📌 HMI Stoplight and Crosswalk Simulator, PLC Implementation using Allen Bradley Systems 🚸
