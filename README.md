# Hi There! 😁

## About Me 👩🏼‍💻
My name is Zoe Bailey (she/her), I am a senior at West Virginia University studying computer engineering. Within the University I am involved as the Awards and Grants Chair for WVU's chapter of the Society of Women Engineers. I have worked with artificial intellegence (machine learning, computer vision, natural language proccessing), and spesificially AI in the health and legal sectors. I am interested in any work that helps the greater good of humanity. Otherwise, in my free time I enjoy watching reality TV and playing video games!

## Tech Stack 💻
I have experience and expertise coding in multiple languages including:
- Python 🐍
- Java ☕️
- C 🛜
- MATLAB 👷🏼‍♀️
- PLC 🪜
- HTML 🕸️
- CSS 👩🏼‍🎨
- VHDL ⚙️
- JavaScript 🔁
- C++ ➕

## Key Projects 🔧
📌 WeatherWeGo, Weather Website (2025)

📌 AI in the Legal Sector, Chronology Generating Bot for LegalDuel (2024) 👩🏼‍⚖️

Working with LegalDuel, me and a team of two other students created a chatbot to successfully generate legal chronologies given a document. Legal chronologies can be very burdensome and tedious to write, so to aid the legal sector, we used AI to help! We used Python, HTML, Java, and more to code. We implemented ChatGPT's API to aid us in completion and evaluation. Along with this, we made a website to host these tasks (and generate a visual timeline)!

📌 LED Temperature Sensor, Transmitting Code for Microprocessor Systems Project (2024) 🌡️

For my microprocessor systems (CPE 310 @ WVU) class, our final project was to use a temerature sensor to control an LED and facilitate communication between two Texas Instrument boards, and two computers. This was done as a project as a final for all the work we had done up to this point in the semester. The goal was to have temperature thresholds to categorize different temperatures (too hot, just right, too cold), and correlate these with a coresponding LED being shown on the reciving board (blue, green, red). If blue was shown that was supposed to represent a coolant system to cool the board, while red indicated a heating system to heat. Communication between the sensor and LED was facilitated using Putty. The coding for this project was done through C and ARM.

📌 AI to Detect Cancerous Cells, Computer Vision with AI Camp (2020) 🩻

For an AI camp project, me and a group of several other students decided to explore computer vision and how it could help in the medical sector. We created a computer vision system to detect whether an image of a cell was cancerous or not. This could prove helpful as detecting malignant cells can be difficult for the human eye. We used Python, HTML, and CSS to code this project. After training, testing, and validating the model on a set of data, we were able to implement the project through a website (no longer active).

📌 HMI Stoplight and Crosswalk Simulator, PLC Implementation using Allen Bradley Systems (2020) 🚸

As a project to work on for personal fun and in conjunction with PLC Geeks, I created a simulation of a stop light and crosswalk. These were both displayed on HMIs and programmed using PLC ladder logic. There were 2 lights on display (one for north/south traffic another for east/west traffic) and 2 crosswalk signals on display (again for north/south and east/west). The lights were synchronized among themselves and to the crosswalk timers as well.
